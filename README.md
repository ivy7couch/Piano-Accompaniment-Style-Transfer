## Abstract
Arranger-specific style transfer for pop piano covers requires effective content-style disentanglement. To address this, we propose a framework that uses a lead sheet (namely, melody and chords) as a style-agnostic content anchor, enabling precise style manipulation without requiring paired data. We then systematically compare several Transformer-based architectures to evaluate the efficacy of a direct token-based conditioning strategy versus more complicated embedding-based methods. While all approaches effectively capture the target style, our evaluation shows that the simpler token-based model achieves superior performance in both objective and subjective assessments of content preservation and style matching. This finding provides empirical evidences that a robust, explicit content representation (i.e., the lead sheet) is highly effective for this task, offering a practical benchmark for controllable music generation.
